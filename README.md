This page will show the date of the predicted day and the value of the min and max of the day.For the icon in the future we will calculate which icon appears the most in the day. Now the icons is the icons of the middle of the day.

### For the future

- I would like to add a map on the application
- That my api calls are smaller in size
- Improve the UX
- Add some information about air quality and implement it in a map too
